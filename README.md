## Introduction 🧙‍♂️✨

Greetings, everyone! I'm [@shreyamalogi](https://github.com/shreyamalogi), and I've created the COVID-19 Enchantment Notifier. This project is your magical companion to stay updated on the ever-changing world of COVID-19. Imagine your computer becoming a magical oracle that whispers the latest COVID-19 numbers to keep you informed. It's like casting a spell to bring real-time updates to your desktop. 🌌📜

## Casting the Enchantment Spell 🌐✨

### Step 1: Gather the Magical Ingredients

- Feel the magic – clone the repository using:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shreyamalogi/Pandemic-Alert.git
  ```

- Make sure your computer understands the language of Python. If not, seek help from someone more experienced.
- Acquire the enchanted ingredients named requests, beautifulsoup4, and plyer. Add them with the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 plyer
  ```

### Step 2: Unleash the Spell

- Find a quiet space on your computer where magic flows freely.
- Open the terminal, your gateway to the mystical realm.
- Cast the spell to run the enchantment script:

  ```bash
  python script_name.py
  ```

  Watch as the enchantment unfolds, and your computer whispers COVID-19 updates to you!

## Bonus Spellbook (Optional)

If you want to adjust the timing between updates, open the script and find the spell:

```python
time.sleep(30)  # Adjust the interval (in seconds) as needed
```
