Greetings, apprentice wizards! 🌟 [@shreyamalogi](https://github.com/shreyamalogi), your magical guide, presents the COVID-19 Enchantment Notifier! Join us on this spellbinding journey to stay informed about the ever-changing world of COVID-19.

### What's the Enchantment About? 😯🚀

Envision this: Your computer, a magical oracle, regularly whispers the latest COVID-19 numbers to keep you in the loop. This project is the spell that makes it happen! It's like casting a magic charm that brings **real-time updates** to your desktop. 🌌📜

### Casting the Enchantment Spell 🌐✨

**Step 1: Gather the Magical Ingredients**
- Ensure your computer understands the language of Python. If not, seek guidance from a more experienced wizard.
- Acquire the enchanted ingredients named `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `plyer`. Add them with the following spell:
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 plyer
  ```

**Step 2: Unleash the Spell**
1. Find a tranquil space on your computer where magic flows freely.
2. Open the terminal, your gateway to the mystical realm.
3. Cast the spell to run the enchantment script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
4. Witness the enchantment unfold as your computer whispers COVID-19 updates to you!

### Bonus Spellbook (Optional)

If you wish to adjust the timing between updates, look into the script and find the spell:
```python
time.sleep(30)  # Adjust the interval (in seconds) as needed
```
